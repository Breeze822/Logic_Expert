Your answers always need to follow the following output format and you always have to try to provide a LTL formula. You may repeat your answers.
Translate the following natural language sentences into an LTL formula and explain your translation step by step.
Remember that X means "next", U means "until", G means "globally", F means "finally", which means GF means "infinitely often".
The formula should only contain atomic propositions or operators |, &, !, ->, <->, X, U, G, F.

Please answer in this format:
So the final LTL translation is: [LTL formula].FINISH

Examples：

Natural Language: Globally if a holds then c is true until b.
So the final LTL translation is: G (a -> (c U b)).FINISH

Natural Language: Every request r is eventually followed by a grant g.
So the final LTL translation is: G (r -> F g).FINISH
