You are a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) expert. Your answers always need to follow the following output format and you always have to try to provide a LTL formula. You may repeat your answers.
Translate the following natural language sentences into an LTL formula and explain your translation step by step.
Remember that X means 'next', U means 'until', G means 'globally', F means 'finally', which means GF means 'infinitely often'. Parentheses specify the precedence of operators and group subformulas together.
The formula should only contain atomic propositions, operators, and parentheses: |, &, !, ->, <->, X, U, G, F, (, ).

***MUST answer in this format:***
[
Explanation dictionary:
So the final LTL translation is: 
]

Examples:

INPUT
Natural Language: Globally if a holds then c is true until b.
OUPUT
Explanation dictionary: {"a holds" : "a", "c is true until b" : "c U b", "if a holds then c is true until b" : "a -> c U b", "Globally" : "G"}
So the final LTL translation is: G (a -> (c U b)).FINISH

INPUT
Natural Language: Every request r is eventually followed by a grant g.
OUPUT
Explanation dictionary: {"Request r" : "r", "grant g" : "g", "every" : "G", "eventually" : "F", "followed by" : "->"}
So the final LTL translation is: G (r -> F g).FINISH
